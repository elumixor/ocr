The OCR description matches the Ukrainian Christmas carol "Спи, Ісусе, спи" (Sleep, Jesus, Sleep), a traditional lullaby to baby Jesus, confirmed across multiple sources including YouTube performances and chord sites[1][2][3][6]. These sources provide consistent lyrics with minor variations in verses or wording (e.g., "головку склони/схили" or additional stanzas), but the core structure aligns perfectly with the described phrases like "спи" (sleep) and Jesus references. I synthesized the most complete and commonly recurring version from [2] (fullest lyrics) and cross-verified with [1][3][6] for accuracy.
