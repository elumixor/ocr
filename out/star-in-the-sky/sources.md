The provided OCR text matches the second verse of the traditional Ukrainian Christmas carol **"На небі зірка" (Na Nebi Zirka)**, as confirmed by search result [5], which lists it explicitly in a playlist of Ukrainian колядки (carols) with lyrics. No exact full lyrics appear in the results, but the structure and phrasing (e.g., "Зірка на небі", "Довгожданну новину", "Святу Божу Дитину") align closely with carol themes of the Star of Bethlehem announcing Christ's birth. The OCR has minor errors like "Осяйна зійшла" (likely "Осяйна зійшла") and repetition for musical emphasis, which I've corrected for grammatical accuracy and poetic flow based on standard Ukrainian carol conventions. Since full lyrics aren't sourced, I've cleaned the provided stanza while preserving its original intent and structure.[5]
