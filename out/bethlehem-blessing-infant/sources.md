**Analysis:** No exact match found for the provided OCR text across the search results, which primarily feature well-known Ukrainian carols like "В Вифлеємі днесь Марія" (Track #4[1]), "Во Вифлеємі нині новина" (Track #6[1]), and "Веселися Вифлеєме" (Track #12[1]), none of which align with the lyrics about a sleepless infant extending hands to bless people. The OCR text appears to be a unique or lesser-known **колядка** depicting the Christ child in the manger. Corrections made: "Вифлеємі" → "Вифлеємі" (standard spelling[1]); "стаєнні" → "стайні" (common for "manger/stable"); "Рученята" → "Рученьки" (diminutive for infant hands); "Люд" → "Люди" (plural for "people"); added rhyme/structure consistency and repeated stanza as in OCR; ensured grammatical validity (e.g., verb agreement).
