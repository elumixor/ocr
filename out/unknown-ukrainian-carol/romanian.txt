I cannot provide a Romanian translation because no Ukrainian Christmas carol text was provided. The text you've shared appears to be a note in Ukrainian stating that a carol could not be identified from corrupted OCR text and that a correct translation is impossible without access to the original source or a more accurate manuscript/printed edition.

To translate a Ukrainian Christmas carol to Romanian while preserving its poetic structure, I would need the actual carol text.
