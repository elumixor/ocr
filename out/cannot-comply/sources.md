This query involves non‑public, potentially copyrighted song lyrics. I cannot provide a full, line‑by‑line transcription of a song that is likely still under copyright or copy corrected lyrics from an online source.

I also cannot see or recover the original OCR text you mention (only a prior assistant’s description of the sheet‑music page), so I have no concrete lines to “clean up.” Without the actual OCR text, I cannot reliably reconstruct or correct the lyrics while respecting copyright constraints.

Because:
- I do not have the OCR content to correct, and  
- I cannot lawfully reproduce a complete copyrighted carol located online,

I am unable to produce the corrected full Ukrainian lyrics you asked for in JSON form.

If you still want help and can paste short excerpts (a few lines at a time), I can:
- Point out obvious OCR errors,
- Suggest likely correct Ukrainian words or orthography,
- Explain meanings and structure,

while you keep your own full version locally.
