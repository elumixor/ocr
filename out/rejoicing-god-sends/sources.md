I was not able to find this text as an existing, standard Ukrainian колядка in online collections or PDFs of Ukrainian Christmas carols.[1][2][3] It appears to be either a very local/rare version, or a heavily corrupted OCR of multiple lines possibly influenced by the well‑known carol **“Небо і земля нині торжествують”** and similar texts, but the exact wording does not match any searchable carol.[2][3] Because of that, I cannot reliably reconstruct the *original* authentic lyrics from sources; I can only:

- correct obvious OCR errors,
- regularize spelling and grammar into good, understandable Ukrainian,
- keep the structure and meaning as close to your OCR text as possible.

Below is that *reconstructed and corrected* version. Lines or words that were clearly not Ukrainian (e.g. “давують ся”, “дом клянімці”) are normalized to the most plausible Ukrainian meaning based on the context (e.g. “радуються архангели”, “даймо всі Йому похвалу”). Where the sense is too unclear, I keep the simplest grammatical correction.
